# 🐍 snake 🐍

Multiplatform 2D snake game written in Go.

Play it at -> soon :D

## Lore

I've loved the snake game since I was a child. Nowadays I can't find one that I really like, so I've decided to program my own game.

I've chosen Go because I like the language and I want to practice it. It uses the [ebiten 2D game engine](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten).

## Dev

Install the project requiered packages and run the main file:

```
go run main.go
```
