# snake

I love the snake game since I'm a child. Nowadays I can't find one that I really like, so I've decided to program my own.

I've chosen Go because I love the language and I want to practice it. It uses the [ebiten 2D game engine](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten).

# Dev

Tis game is still a WIP, so the only way to run it is for developers:

```
go run main.go
```
